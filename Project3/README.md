# Project 3

Build a data lakehouse solution for sensor data that trains a machine learning model.

Spark and AWS Glue allow you to process data from multiple sources, categorize the data, and curate it to be queried in the future for multiple purposes. In this project you will directly use the skills you have used, including some of the code you have already written.

AWS Glue, AWS S3, Python, and Spark, create or generate Python scripts to build a lakehouse solution in AWS that satisfies these requirements from the STEDI data scientists.
