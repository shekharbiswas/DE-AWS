**Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb** - This demonstrates how we can use Apache Cassandra DB modelling to create NoSQL tables specific to Queries.

Concepts:

- Define a ETL process to create CSV from multiple files in the workspace
- Create 3 NoSQL tables specific to 3 different queries
- Ensure Data Model should have a UNIQUE Primary Key and no usage of ALLOW FILTERING.
- Define PARTITION KEY alone or with the addition of CLUSTERING COLUMNS in each Data Model.
- Choosing Partition Key and Clustering Column
- Composite Partition Key
