Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb - This demonstrates how we can use Apache Cassandra to create a NoSQL tables specific to queries.

Concepts:

Define a ETL process to create CSV from multiple files in the workspace
Create 3 NoSQL tables specific to 3 different queries
Ensure Data Model should have a UNIQUE Primary Key and no usage of ALLOW FILTERING.
Define PARTITION KEY alone or with the addition of CLUSTERING COLUMNS in each Data Model.
