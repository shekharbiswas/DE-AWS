This REPO contains the Projects from Udacity DE AWS Nanodegree:

1. **Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb** - This demonstrates how we can use Apache Cassandra to create a NoSQL tables specific to queries.

Concepts:

- Define a ETL process to create CSV from multiple files in the workspace
- Create 3 NoSQL tables specific to 3 different queries
