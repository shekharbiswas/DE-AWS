This REPO contains the Projects from Udacity DE AWS Nanodegree:

# Project 1:
**Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb** - This demonstrates how we can use Apache Cassandra to create a NoSQL tables specific to queries.

Concepts:

- Define a ETL process to create CSV from multiple files in the workspace
- Create 3 NoSQL tables specific to 3 different queries
- Ensure Data Model should have a UNIQUE Primary Key and no usage of ALLOW FILTERING.
- Define PARTITION KEY alone or with the addition of CLUSTERING COLUMNS in each Data Model.


# Project 2:

Build a data warehouse solution on the AWS cloud.

Extract data from AWS S3, transform it using SQL and Python, and load it into an AWS Redshift data warehouse.

# Project 3:

As a data engineer for the STEDI team, build a data lakehouse solution for sensor data that trains a machine learning model.

Extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, and curate them into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model.
